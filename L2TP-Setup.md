set service nat rule 5003 source address 172.19.1.0/24
set service nat rule 5003 type masquerade
```

## troubleshooting 
If you have problems setting up L2TP consider to take a look at the following log files:
- /var/log/messages
- /var/log/charon.log
- note that the usernames aren't logged. 

I you want to see who is currently connected just type: "show interfaces"
